### the words (features) and authors (labels), already largely processed
### these files should have been created from the previous (Lesson 10) mini-project.
words_file = "../text_learning/your_word_data.pkl" 
authors_file = "../text_learning/your_email_authors.pkl"
word_data = pickle.load( open(words_file, "r"))

### test_size is the percentage of events assigned to the test set (remainder go into training)
### feature matrices changed to dense representations for compatibility with classifier
### functions in versions 0.15.2 and earlier
from sklearn import cross_validation
features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(word_data, authors, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5,
                             stop_words='english')
features_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(features_train)
features_test  = vectorizer.transform(features_test).toarray()


### a classic way to overfit is to use a small number
### of data points and a large number of features
### train on only 150 events to put ourselves in this regime
features_train = features_train[:150].toarray()
labels_train   = labels_train[:150]



### your code goes here
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf=DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(features_train,labels_train)
pred=clf.predict(features_test)
print accuracy_score(pred,labels_test)

print max(importance_features)
print numpy.argmax(importance_features)

print vectorizer.get_feature_names()[numpy.argmax(importance_features)]

for counter, importance in enumerate(importance_features):
    if importance > 0.2:
        print "Counter and importance :", counter, " - ", importance, " ", vectorizer.get_feature_names()[counter]
